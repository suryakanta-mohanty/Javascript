    /* The `yield` keyword pauses generator function execution and the value of the expression 
        following the  `yield` keyword is returned to the generator's caller. It can be thought of as 
        a generator-based version of the `return` keyword.

    // In JavaScript, a generator function is like this magical storybook. 
    // You can pause it and resume it whenever you want. Here's how it looks:

    // 1. function*: The `*` after `function` means it's a special kind of function, a generator.
    // 2. yield: This is like saying, "pause here and give this part of the story."
    function* storyBook(){
      yield 'Once upon a time...'
      yield 'there was a brave kinght...'
      yield 'who saved the kingdom!'
    }

    let story = storyBook();
    
    console.log(story.next().value);  // Once upon a time...
    console.log(story.next());  // {value: 'there was a brave kinght...', done: false}

    console.log(story.next().value);  // there was a brave kinght...
    console.log(story.next().value);  // who saved the kingdom!
    console.log(story.next());  // {value: undefined, done: true}


    // `storyBook()` gives us the magical storybook (a generator object).
    // `story.next().value` reads the next part of the story.

    // Every time you call `next()`, the storybook opens and reads the next part, 
    // then stops until you call `next()` again.



    // generator as an object property

    const someObj = { *generator(){
      yield 'a';
      yield 'b';
    }};

    const gen = someObj.generator();

    console.log(gen.next()); // {value: 'a', done: false}
    console.log(gen.next().value); // b
    console.log(gen.next()); // {value: undefined, done: true}
